PROJECT - SANTA COMMON WORLD

Understand how routing works
Understand what is an API
Get acquainted with the JSON data format
The time has come: this project is your first web application! You will build a small API (a web application that returns data, not web pages) with the ExpressJS framework.

The project is split in two parts, this is the first one. You will start building the API without a database. Once your API works, you'll beef it up!
